![](../data/homeexchange_slack.jpg)

HomeExchange is a popular alternative to Airbnb that enables house swapping. The registration process is free, and users only pay the annual membership fee of â‚¬160 when they find their first exchange.

HomeExchange aims to understand the reasons behind customer churn. Various variables, such as user seniority, activity as a guest or host, sponsorship, and subscriptions obtained through promotions, are available to determine their impact on the churn rate.

This repository showcases data analysis and predictions for HomeExchange, including:

- Analysis of Churn: Static visualization (charts in PNG format) or interactive notebooks (viewable via nbviewer: https://nbviewer.org/).
- Web Scraping: Extracting data from Trustpilot to track the evolution of HomeExchange's rating score.
- Churn Prediction: Utilizing classification algorithms to forecast which users are likely to unsubscribe from the platform.
